# Lectures

This is a collection of lectures that I have given at App Academy.

## How to use this repo

Links to external sources of information will be provided when possible, _however_ I highly encourage you to **read over the entire file first** and then consult the additional links if you want clarification or have any questions. The links (mainly MDN) can get very complicated very fast, and I've tried to distill the important information in the main file so you don't have to sift through pages and pages of MDN yourself.

Also, try out the code examples provided and play with them. Try different things to test your understanding of the concepts.

## Contents

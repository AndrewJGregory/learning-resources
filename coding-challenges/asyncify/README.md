# Asyncify

### Prompt

You're given data in a CSV file containing information about [US baby names from 1880 to 2009](https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names). Your goal is to write three functions that print out how many times a target name is contained in the file. These three functions will handle asynchronicity differently, using a callback, a promise, then utilizing `async`/`await`. You are welcome to Google anything you want, but be prepared to explain your code.

### Instructions

Clone this repo and work within `main.js`. Do not modify the existing code in the file but fill in the blanks. Do not look at the solution until you are completely finished with the challenge.

### Learning Goals

- Gain knowledge of different ways to handle asynchronicity in JavaScript
- Work within Node.js
- Learn how to google things that you do not know. MDN will be an invaluable resource during this challenge.
